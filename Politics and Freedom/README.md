# Politics and Freedom
_"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. Benjamin Franklin, 1775"_
_"He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself."  James Madison_
