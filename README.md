# Good Knowledge

_“[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.”_ — Richard Hamming

## World Development & Trends

### Tech
- Decentralizing the Cloud - data market in 2025 will be worth close to 1 [Trillion USD](https://sinovate.medium.com/sinovate-cloud-3-0-a-guaranteed-decentralization-for-an-optimal-data-storage-4c38141d8d1d).

  - new promising tech: perovskite, which can be manufactured on elastic surfaces, uses 1000 times less material than silicon cells, which makes it cheaper to produce solar panels. Effeciency expected in the 30% (theoretical 86% but not practical). Silicon crystalizes around 1410 degrees Celcius, but perovskite can be formed at less than 100 degrees Celcius (<212 Farenheit) which enables usage of smaller equipment. Solar cells can be printed on e.g. lightweight and elastic material such as plastic.
- VR Immersion
- Room Temp Superconductivity
- Nuclear Fusion
  - China has built 126 nuclear reactors between 1987 and 2022. Between 2022 and 2037, China will build 150 more.
  - Helium3, moon
